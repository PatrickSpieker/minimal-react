## Minimal React

My minimal React config! It uses:

- Webpack for bundling
- Babel + `preset-react` for loading JSX files
- React, which is a dependency of `preset-react`

### Installation

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli react react-dom babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-react
```

### Usage

```
webpack --config webpack.config.js
python3 -m http.server
```
